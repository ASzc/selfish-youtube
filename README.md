# Selfish YouTube - Remove YouTube's share panel

## Background

Selfish YouTube is a greasemonkey script for YouTube users who never want to share the videos they watch.

YouTube's most recent layout includes a Share panel on the watch page, along with more useful panels, like the About panel. Annoyingly, any time you click the Like button, the active panel will be changed from the About panel to the Share panel, requiring another click to bring back the About panel.

## Operation

Selfish YouTube executes on any YouTube **watch page** (i.e. youtube.com/watch?v=somevideoid). It will **remove** the **Share panel**, making it impossible for the UI to activate the panel. The the **Share button** is **also removed**, for the sake of appearance.

## Installation

Selfish Youtube has been tested on **Firefox** version **20.0.1**, with **Greasemonkey** version **1.8**.

Selfish Youtube is available from [userscripts.org](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/166809).

Alternatively, navigate directly to the [raw script file](../../raw/master/selfish-youtube.user.js) with your browser to trigger an installation prompt.
